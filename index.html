            <p>We'll lay all these little funky little things in there. You've got to learn to fight the temptation to resist these things. Just let them happen. It's important to me that you're happy. The man who does the best job is the one who is happy at his job. Every time you practice, you learn more. Everything's not great in life, but we can still find beauty in it.</p>

<p>By now you should be quite happy about what's happening here. If we're going to have animals around we all have to be concerned about them and take care of them. Everyone needs a friend. Friends are the most valuable things in the world. Let's put a touch more of the magic here. Fluff that up.</p>

<p>Everyone wants to enjoy the good parts - but you have to build the framework first. Trees grow in all kinds of ways. They're not all perfectly straight. Not every limb is perfect. All you have to learn here is how to have fun. Now it's beginning to make a little sense. And that's when it becomes fun - you don't have to spend your time thinking about what's happening - you just let it happen. They say everything looks better with odd numbers of things. But sometimes I put even numbers—just to upset the critics.</p>

<p>Painting should do one thing. It should put happiness in your heart. Just let this happen. We just let this flow right out of our minds. It's almost like something out of a fairytale book. Let's go up in here, and start having some fun I'm gonna start with a little Alizarin crimson and a touch of Prussian blue</p>

<p>Let all these things just sort of happen. Volunteering your time; it pays you and your whole community fantastic dividends. This is the time to get out all your flustrations, much better than kicking the dog around the house or taking it out on your spouse. There's nothing wrong with having a tree as a friend. Only God can make a tree - but you can paint one.</p>

<p>We want to use a lot pressure while using no pressure at all. You can't make a mistake. Anything that happens you can learn to use - and make something beautiful out of it. I can't think of anything more rewarding than being able to express yourself to others through painting.</p>

<p>Use what happens naturally, don't fight it. You have to make these big decisions. Look around, look at what we have. Beauty is everywhere, you only have to look to see it. When things happen - enjoy them. They're little gifts. Let's have a happy little tree in here.</p>
